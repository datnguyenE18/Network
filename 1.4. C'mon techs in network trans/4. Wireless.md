# **Wireless** 

Wireless is a wireless network system that uses radio waves, like cell phones, television, and radio. The system allows access to the Internet in areas with signal strength of this system, completely without the need for connecting cables.

The system consists of radio signal receiving and transmitting stations, after the user device transmits data to the receiving / transmitting station, the frequency wave signal will be modulated into an electrical signal, this electrical signal will be transmitted to the servers. The application then returns to the receiving / transmitting station, the transceiver station after receiving data from the application servers will reverse modulate the electrical signal into a frequency wave signal and transmit it to the user device.

Wireless has the advantage that there is no cost to deploy the transmission line, but the disadvantage is that the data transmission signal may be weaker or attenuated more strongly than wire transmission technologies.

Wireless is used in the home as a wifi transmitter that uses frequencies 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz to transmit data

In the military, wireless is applied to radio, radar, or satellite communication devices
