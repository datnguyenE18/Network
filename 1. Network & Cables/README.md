# **Network & Cables** 



**Communication - Network**

Data communication is the process of sharing and transmitting information data by performing actions or through the use of technologies designed between individuals and organizations to transmit data from one place to another or from one individual to another



Computer network is a group of computers and peripheral devices connected to each other through transmission media such as twisted pair, optical fiber, electromagnetic waves, infrared rays, etc. to transmit data to each other.

The data transmitted from one machine to another are all binary bits 0 and 1, which, after being converted into voltages or electromagnetic waves, will be transmitted through the transmission medium and to the destination

**+ Network Cables (Cáp mạng Ethernet)**

A network cable is a material used to connect one network device to other network devices to transmit light waves, or electromagnetic waves, that carry information between devices.

Network cables known as twisted conductors made of metal or alloy are divided into many different types, but mainly copper and optical cables wrapped in an insulating plastic sheath. This cable is often used in the field of information technology with the task of transmitting information signals to connect computers together, forming a complete network.

Ethernet network cable is an electrical signal cable used to connect devices together in a local area network such as computers, routers and switches, or connect from modems to computers etc.

**+ Coaxial cable (Cáp đồng trục)**

Coaxial cable is a type of electrical cable with all layers of cables sharing a conductive core shaft and wrapped by a non-conductive dielectric layer, surrounded by a metal braid, and the outermost has an insulating sheath.

- A: plastic cover outside
- B: metal braided shell
- C: insulator
- D: copper core or copper coated metal

Its applications include supply lines between radio transceivers and antennas, television cables, camera conductors, etc.

The digital signal transmitted on the cable only exists inside the cable core so that we can install the cable next to metal materials without fear of energy loss

**+ Optical cable (Cáp Quang):**

Optical cable is a type of cable that transmits light waves or optical signals, with a transmission core made of glass, and is used in most of today's internet systems.

Fiber optic cable can transmit signals for a distance of up to 60 km while still ensuring the signal, and has a transmission speed from 1Gb to 10Gb, so it is often used for data transmission between data centers, jumper wires in server rooms, or connection wires from the internet provider to the user's modem.
